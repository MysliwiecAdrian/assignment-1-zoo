        Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with necks that can reach up 
        to 6 feet long, allowing them to eat leaves from the tops of trees. 
        They have unique spotted coats, and no two giraffes have the same 
        pattern. Giraffes' long tongues, which can be up to 20 inches, help 
        them grasp food and avoid thorns. Surprisingly, despite their long 
        necks, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humansâ€”just 
        seven!
