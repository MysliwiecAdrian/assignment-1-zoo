      Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching 
      speeds up to 60 mph in short bursts. Native to Africa, they 
      have slender bodies, long legs, and distinctive black "tear 
      marks" under their eyes to reduce glare while hunting. 
      Cheetahs rely on speed and stealth to catch prey but tire quickly. 
      Despite their incredible speed, they face threats from habitat 
      loss and competition with larger predators, making conservation 
      efforts essential.
