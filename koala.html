    <p>
      Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials from Australia, 
      known for their fluffy ears and relaxed lifestyle. 
      They sleep up to 20 hours a day due to their low-energy 
      diet of eucalyptus leaves. Despite their sleepy nature, 
      koalas are skilled climbers, using sharp claws to grip 
      trees. Unfortunately, habitat loss and disease threaten 
      their survival, making conservation vital.
