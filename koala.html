        Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials from Australia, 
        known for their fluffy ears and relaxed lifestyle. 
        They sleep up to 20 hours a day due to their low-energy 
        diet of eucalyptus leaves. Despite their sleepy nature, 
        koalas are skilled climbers, using sharp claws to grip 
        trees. Unfortunately, habitat loss and disease threaten 
        their survival, making conservation vital.
