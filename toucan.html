        Toucans are tropical birds known for their oversized, colorful bills, which 
        can be as long as their body. Native to Central and South American rainforests, 
        their bills help them reach fruit on distant branches and regulate body temperature. 
        Despite their large beaks, toucans are light and agile flyers. Their loud calls 
        echo through the forest, and they often live in small flocks, adding a splash of color 
        to the treetops with their vibrant feathers.
